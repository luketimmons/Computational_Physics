# Computational_Physics
Code produced as part of a computational physics course taken during the second year of my undergraduate degree. The problem sets highlight the progression in the complexity of  both the C++ code used throughout the module as well as the complexity of the problems to be considered, coinciding with a final project exploring the Lorenz model of fluid dynamics.
